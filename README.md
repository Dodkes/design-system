# Initial Lean Deisgn System structure

- `preview.ts` is equivalent to `index.html` -> include files/edit storybook behavior there

## Getting project ready for development:

1. Set up breakpoints: `~/base/breakpoints.scss`
2. Set up typography: `~/base/typography.scss`
3. Add variables: `~/base/variables.scss`

## Storybook UI adjustment:

In `/storybook/preview.ts` set up:

- breakpoints
- theme
- background colors dark/light

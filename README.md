# Initial Lean Deisgn System architecture

- `preview.ts` is equivalent to `index.html` -> include files/edit storybook behavior here

## Getting project ready for development:

- Set up breakpoints: `~/base/breakpoints.scss`
- Set up typography: `~/base/typography.scss`
- Add variables: `~/base/variables.scss`

## Storybook UI setup:

### In `/storybook/theme.ts` set up:

- breakpoints
- theme
- background colors dark/light
